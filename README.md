## Jstan

Jstan is a Java library for running MCMC models
with Stan (https://mc-stan.org), a state of the art
statistical modeling and high performance computation
engine.

This library allows you to create, compile and run models
with the JVM. Complex bayesian data analysis problems have
typically been relegated to python, R, etc, where implemention
is far from production.

The goal of this project to be added to the offical list of implementations
with the Stan project, so that JVM language users will have access
to the power of Stan from the JVM.
